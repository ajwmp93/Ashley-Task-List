# My Task Board

## Description
I made this webpage to be an easily accessible one stop shop for all of my tasks that I need to do. Using this webpage, I am able to add all of my tasks and then move them to the corresponding boxes in terms of their status. This will make it easy to see which tasks are urgent and which tasks still need to be done and move them when I have started and finished them. This project introduced many new JavaScript elements that I am still trying to learn and was a quick introduction to them.

## Usage
To use this webpage, click the add task button and fill out the form that pops up in the doalog box. When you submit the form, your task will appear on screen as a task card, which you can drag and drop to the corresponding status lane. The card will also be orange if the due date is close to the current date or red if it is past the current date.

## Credits
I will be assisted by a tutor later this week to work out why the task cards are not rendering and to help me better understand the JavaScript, I will add their name after I have completed that session. I used code we worked on in our class modules as well as some snippets from Xpert Learning AI.
